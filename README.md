HEMATOVISION-ADVANCED-BLOOD-CELL-CLASSIFICATION

🧬 HematoVision: Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning HematoVision is an advanced AI-driven project focused on classifying blood cells using cutting-edge transfer learning techniques. Built with a dataset of over 12,000 annotated images, this tool aids pathologists and healthcare professionals in delivering accurate and fast diagnostics.

🧠 Overview HematoVision is a deep learning web app that classifies blood cell images into four categories using transfer learning. It helps in identifying blood disorders by analyzing microscopic images.

🔍 Classes Eosinophil Lymphocyte Monocyte Neutrophil

📌 Project Highlights 🔍 Classification of 4 key blood cell types: 🧪 Eosinophils 🧫 Lymphocytes 🧬 Monocytes 🧠 Neutrophils

🤖 Model Base: Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (e.g., ResNet, VGG)

⚡ Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained image features to boost accuracy and reduce training time

🧠 Efficient & Scalable: Ideal for real-world healthcare and lab environments

🧭 Project Flow 🖼️ User uploads an image through a simple Flask-based UI.

📊 The image is processed and analyzed by the integrated deep learning model.

✅ Prediction results (blood cell type) are displayed back in the UI.

🧪 Data Augmentation Although data augmentation is typically a crucial step in image-based classification tasks, in this case, the dataset was pre-cropped and pre-augmented. As a result:

⏳ Training time increased slightly due to the lack of augmentation during model training

🎯 Accuracy remained stable due to the diversity already present in the dataset

Common augmentation techniques include:

🔄 Rotation

🔍 Scaling

🌗 Brightness/Contrast Adjustment

↔️ Horizontal/Vertical Flipping

These methods are instrumental in enhancing model generalization and robustness, especially in datasets with limited labeled samples.
